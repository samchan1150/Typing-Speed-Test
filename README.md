# Typing Speed Test Application

Welcome to the Typing Speed Test Application!

This interactive typing test is designed to help you improve your typing speed and accuracy in a fun and customizable way. Whether you're just starting out or looking to hone your skills, this app offers features that cater to all levels.

## How the App Works

### Selecting the Number of Words
- **Preset Options**: You can choose from preset word counts—10, 20, 30, 50, or 100 words—by selecting an option from the dropdown menu. This allows for quick and easy test setup based on your preference.
- **Custom Word Count**: If you'd like a specific number of words not listed in the presets, you can enter a custom word count in the input field provided. Simply type any number between 1 and 1000 to tailor the test to your needs.

### Starting the Test
- **Generating Words**: Once you've selected or entered your desired word count, the app generates a randomized list of words for you to type. These words are displayed on the screen, each separated and highlighted individually.
- **Begin Typing**: Click inside the text area labeled "Start typing here..." to begin the test. The timer will start automatically as soon as you press your first key.

### Real-Time Feedback and Functionality
- **Current Word Highlighting**: The word you're currently typing is highlighted to help you stay on track. As you progress, the highlight moves to the next word.
- **Error Detection and Correction**:
  - **Incorrect Words**: If you type a word incorrectly, it will be highlighted in red.
  - **Correct Words**: Correctly typed words are highlighted in green.
  - **Backspace Functionality**: You can use the backspace key to correct mistakes at any time. The app allows you to return to previous words to fix errors, and it adjusts your results accordingly.

### Progress Tracking
- **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Your typing speed is calculated in real-time and displayed as WPM. This metric shows how many words you're typing per minute based on the number of correct words and the elapsed time.
- **Accuracy Percentage**: The app calculates your accuracy by comparing the number of correct words to the total words typed. This percentage updates as you type, giving you immediate feedback on your performance.

### Completing the Test
- **End of Test Detection**: The test concludes automatically once you've typed all the words in the list. You don't need to press any special keys or add extra spaces at the end—the app recognizes when the final word is completed correctly.
- **Final Results**: After finishing, you'll receive a summary of your performance, including your final WPM and accuracy percentage. The app also provides feedback messages to encourage you or suggest areas for improvement based on your results.

### Starting a New Test
- **Resetting**: You can start a new test at any time by clicking the "Start New Test" button. This will reset your stats and generate a new set of words based on your selected or custom word count.
- **Changing Word Count**: Adjusting the word count options will automatically reset the test and provide a fresh list of words.

## Tips for Using the App

### Customizing Your Practice
- Use the custom word count feature to set personal challenges or match the length of texts you're practicing with elsewhere.
- Start with shorter tests to build accuracy, then gradually increase the word count to improve endurance and speed.

### Improving Accuracy
- Take your time to focus on typing each word correctly. Accuracy is just as important as speed.
- Utilize the backspace feature to correct mistakes. The app updates your accuracy and WPM in real-time, so corrections help improve your overall performance.

### Enhancing Speed
- Once you're comfortable with your accuracy, aim to increase your typing speed.
- Practice regularly to build muscle memory and improve finger placement.

### Monitoring Progress
- Keep track of your WPM and accuracy over time to see your improvement.
