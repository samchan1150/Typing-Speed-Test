Create an interactive typing speed test application. This application should allow users to test their typing speed by presenting them with random sentences or paragraphs to type. Key features to include are:

Sentence Generation: Randomly generate sentences or paragraphs for users to type. These should vary in length and complexity to provide a comprehensive test.

Timer: Include a countdown timer that starts when the user begins typing and stops when they finish. Display the elapsed time to the user.

Accuracy Measurement: Measure the user's typing accuracy by comparing the typed text to the provided text. Highlight any mistakes and provide a percentage accuracy score.

WPM Calculation: Calculate the user's typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM). Provide this information at the end of the test.

User Interface: Design a clean and intuitive interface with a text box for typing, a display area for the test sentences, and clear indicators for time, accuracy, and WPM.

Feedback: After the test, display a summary of the user's performance, including their WPM, accuracy, and any areas for improvement.
